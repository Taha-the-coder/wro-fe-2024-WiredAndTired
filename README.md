We are the team called "Wired and Tired". We are participating in the Future Engineers category. Our bot is an autonomous driving car. 
It has three ultrasonic sensors for detecting the obstacles in front of it. Our bot uses a gyroscope sensor. For each 90-degree turn, the bot, with its steering rotates to an angle and turns around to complete the given track.
Moreover, for the second round, we are using huskey lens to detect the red and green blocks. When the blocks are detected it takes a step behind, manages itself to an angle, and turns around according to the rule book. 
Then, it completes the 3 laps if it functions properly.
